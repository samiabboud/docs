## Welcome

## Authentication

API Key authentication involves including a unique key with your request to identify your application. This method is straightforward and suitable for client-side applications.

### Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the header of each request:

```Text Headers
Content-Type: application/json
X-API-Key: YOUR-REST-API-KEY
```

### Error Handling

- 401 Unauthorized: Invalid or missing authentication credentials.
- 403 Forbidden: The authenticated user does not have access to the requested resource.
